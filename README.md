## Introduction
Supervised machine learning algorithms are a class of algorithms that learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset where each input is associated with a corresponding output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. This repository aims to provide implementations of popular supervised machine learning algorithms.
